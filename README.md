I'm imitating Crimson-Desert-Trailer in Pearl Abyss using DirectX11.

It's only consist of Computer Graphics skill like Lod, Tesslation, Mesh, Fulid simulation, Pcf,Pcss, Computer Shader, Shadow Mapping, Graphics Pipeline.

It's very interesting but sometimes quite hard. this result can be extended to Directx12, because the code structure is based on Directx 12 tutorial by Microsoft.
